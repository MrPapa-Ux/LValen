            I hope you're reading this alone. I'd feel a little embarrassed if
            you read this with your friends. Thank you for scanning the barcode
            (I guess I'm asking for too much), and first of all, let me wish you
            a happy 18th birthday ðŸ¥³ (even though it was 22 days ago).

            Long story short, Kenneth and I are close friends. Thenâ€”I saw it. At
            that time, I accidentally saw it by coincidence and without thinking
            twice I immediately took a picture of the letter (because I was very
            curious and interested). I hope you don't have a special
            relationship with him anymore, because what I know about you is not
            as much as you think.
          </p>

            By the way your drawing is so inspiring! Something I've lost is
            starting to come back to me through your art (I believe you know
            which piece I'm talking about). Does this make me seem like a
            stalker? If yes, I apologize; if no, I'm relieved.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So to keep it short, I'm not gonna lie about my feelings, "I like
            you". I'm not entirely sure why I like you, and that's exactly why I
            want to know to make sense of these feelings. I want to know your
            name directly, and I want to understand why you save pictures of
            bright skies. I just want the answers that keep me awake in morning,
            noon, and night.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I see that you're quite close with Hernan, but that's not a problem
            (the problem would be if he were your boyfriendâ€”I don't know the
            specifics about your relationship with him, but after observing you
            two over the past week, it seems you're not as close as before. What
            happened exactly? I'm just curious). To be honest, even after doing
            all of this, I still don't feel confident. So the reason why I'm
            doing all of this, is because I feel responsible for my own
            feelings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Maybe while reading all of this, you feel embarrassed because when I
            wrote it, I didn't consider your feelings enough. I'm sorry for
            that. But the fact that you've read this far, means you appreciate
            every word I've written. And for that, I'm grateful.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you're curious and want to know me better, you can come to the
            location I mentioned below at 12:15 O'Clock in the afternoon on
            Friday, the 14th. And return the Frieren keychain I gave you. If
            you're not curious, feel free to keep it. I'll be waiting for you.
